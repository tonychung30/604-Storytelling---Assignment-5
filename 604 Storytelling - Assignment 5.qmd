## Class Project on Fertility in Different Regions of the World

This was a final project that tested the fertility rates in different regions of the world. The regions were Asia, Europe, North America, North Atlantic, Caribbean, Latin America, and Oceania. Within these regions, I found the average fertility and lifespan of people based on data from countries in those regions. I graphed many plots to show the significance of residuals vs quantities. I also ran a OLD regression model to see what the average life expectancy is in every region.I plot the results as such, and correlation between a higher fertility relates to a lower life expectancy.
